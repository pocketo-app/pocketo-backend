# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.
# They are provided by a third-party and are governed by
# separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support
# documentation.
# This workflow will build a Java project with Gradle and cache/restore any dependencies to improve the workflow execution time

# Cannot declare a global env var which contains GITHUB_SHA env var
# Because GITHUB_SHA only available to every step (not job or workflow)
# Cannot use ${GITHUB_SHA::7} as env value, always specify it in a command
# Because the "::7" part only evaluated at runtime, not in an assignment
